## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite
- **Styling**: CSS3 with modern features (backdrop-filter, custom properties)
- **Animations**: Custom intersection observers, CSS keyframes
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- **Performance**: Optimized with Vite's fast refresh and minimal bundle

## 🎯 Component Organization

### Layout Components (`/layout/`)

Core structural elements that define the page layout and navigation.

### Section Components (`/sections/`)

Main content areas that represent different sections of the portfolio.

### UI Components (`/ui/`)

Reusable interface elements that can be composed within sections.

### Effects Components (`/effects/`)

Specialized components for animations, transitions, and visual effects.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whalephisher/whalephisher.github.io.git
cd whalephisher.github.io
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Build for production**

## 🎨 Customization

### Updating Content

All portfolio content is centralized in `src/data/portfolioData.js`. Update this file to modify:

- Personal information and bio
- Experience timeline
- Skills and technologies
- Education history
- Project portfolio
- Social links

### Styling

- Global styles and CSS variables: `src/styles/global.css`
- Component-specific styles: Located alongside each component
- Color scheme: Teal-based palette with dark theme

### Animations

Custom animation hooks in `src/hooks/useAnimations.js`:

- `useScrollAnimation`: Intersection observer for scroll-triggered effects
- `useTypewriter`: Typewriter text animation
- `useScrollTypewriter`: Scroll-based typewriter with reset
- `useSmoothScroll`: Smooth scrolling navigation
- `useMousePosition`: Mouse tracking for interactive effects
- `useParallax`: Parallax scrolling effects

## 🌟 Performance Features

- **Lazy Loading**: Components load as needed
- **Optimized Animations**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Efficient state management and ref usage
- **Fast Refresh**: Vite's instant hot module replacement

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- CSS backdrop-filter support for glassmorphism effects
